            <p>
                You may share information with a 3rd party entity that has been authorized to participate in delivering and bettering of our client's care plan only in the event that the User or account holder requests for ConnectHealth to do so. The information will be made available to the User first and they will be able to share the information with the 3rd party entity.</p>

            <p>
                Family members who are involved in the User’s care plan Such as daughters, sons, spouses and parents, or a non-family member who has been granted access to Service through an explicit invitation using their email address or phone number as an identifier.

            <h5>
                Government agency and law enforcement
            </h5>
            <p>
                We may disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties if: (i) we are compelled to do so by subpoena, court order or other legal process, (ii) we must do so to comply with laws, statutes, rules or regulations, including credit card rules, (iii) we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our Terms of Service.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We may also use your health information to comply with federal, state or local laws that require disclosure, inform authorities to protect victims of abuse or neglect, comply with national and county health oversight activities such as fraud investigations, respond to law enforcement officials or to judicial orders, subpoenas or other legal processes, inform coroners, medical examiners and funeral directors of information necessary for them to fulfill their duties.
            </p>

            <h5>Mergers &amp; Acquisition</h5>

            <p>If we engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h4>5. YOUR CHOICES</h4>

            <p>Choice is about making sure you have the ability to control how we share your personal information with others. We never share any of your personal information with non-agent third parties.</p>

            <p>We won't share your personal information with non-agent third parties unless we are required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property, rights or those of third parties or the public at large. It is possible that we may, on occasion, buy or sell assets from or to other companies. If that should occur, user information is typically one of the assets that get transferred. Similarly, if ConnectHealth or most of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, User information could be transferred or acquired. You should be aware that such events can occur, and that if it does, the buyer may continue to use your personal and non-personal information, but only as set forth in this policy. Other than in these rare circumstances, ConnectHealth will not rent or sell potentially personally identifying information to anyone.</p>

            <p>We may from time to time request some of your financial information for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the Services, enrolling you in discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, protecting against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business. It's hard to imagine that we would ever consider collecting, let alone sharing, sensitive information with a non-agent third party, but if such a day should come, we will first give you the opportunity to explicitly consent (opt-in) to such disclosure or to any use of the information for a purpose other than the one for which it was originally collected or previously authorized.</p>

            <h4>6. DATA ENCRYPTION &amp; SECURITY</h4>

            <p>Although no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we take reasonable steps to protect all Personal Information. ConnectHealth maintains strict administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers. Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and software systems) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to safeguard the account registration process and sign-up information. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files.</p>

            <h4>7. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
            <p>We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use ConnectHealth after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised Policy. </p>
            <h4>8. CONTACT</h4>
            <p>Please also feel free to contact us if you have any questions about ConnectHealth’s Privacy Policy or practices. You may contact us at support[at]connecthealth[dot] io. </p>
