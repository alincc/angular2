# s3uploader
AWS S3 Uploader for Angular2 using Browser Based POST (Sig Version 4). Going through AWS's docs suckâ€”there's tons of old documentation that you may mistakenly think is still relevant (I did). Hopefully this will give you a quickstart so you don't have to waste a bunch of time figuring out how to get your post signature validated by s3.

## Features

Drag & drop, from ```ng2-file-upload```. Also includes ```APIExampleResponse``` which will show you how to build a S3 signature for your ```FormData``` post that will be properly verified by S3.
