            Updated: March 7, 2016

            <p>ConnectHealth, Inc. (“ConnectHealth”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) operates the www.connecthealth.io website and other related websites and mobile applications (the “Service”).</p>

            <p>Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Terms of Service”, collectively, the “Site”) carefully before using the Service.</p>

            <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing and using the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and all other terms and policies that appear on the Site. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>

            <p>ConnectHealth operates the website located at www.connecthealth.io&nbsp;and other related websites and mobile applications with links to these Terms of Service. We offer online telemedicine services (the “Services”) enabling our users (“Users”) to report their health history and engage healthcare professionals (“Provider” or “Providers”) to obtain a preliminary clinical holding opinion and/or medical and healthcare consultation services (“Services”). </p>

            <p>All of the Providers who deliver Services through ConnectHealth are independent professionals solely responsible for the services each provides to you. ConnectHealth does not practice medicine or any other licensed profession, and does not interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed profession by Providers, each of whom is responsible for his or her services and compliance with the requirements applicable to his or her profession and license. Neither ConnectHealth nor any third parties who promote the Services or provide you with a link to the Service shall be liable for any professional advice you obtain from a Provider via the Services.</p>

            <h4>Content of Site</h4>

            <p>None of the Site content, including but not limited to correspondence with Site support and/or administrators, should be considered medical advice or an endorsement, representation or warranty that any particular medication or treatment is safe, appropriate, or effective for you, other than information you receive directly from Providers. </p>

            <h4>Informed Consent of Users</h4>

            <p>Telemedicine is the delivery of health care services using interactive mobile technology, including but not limited to audio, video, file transfer, and messaging services, where the patient and the health care professional are not in the same physical location. During your telemedicine consultation with a Provider, details of your health history and personal health information may be discussed with you through the use of interactive video, audio and other telecommunications technology.</p>

            <p>The telemedicine Services you receive from Providers are not intended to replace a primary care physician relationship. You should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by a Provider or when otherwise needed, and continue to consult with other healthcare professionals as recommended. At your Provider’ discretion, we may make arrangements for follow up care either through ConnectHealth or other healthcare providers. As with any health service, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine.</p>

            <strong>These risks include, but are not limited to:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate health care decision making by the Provider;</li>
                <li>
                    Delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of the electronic equipment. If this happens, you may be contacted by phone or other means of communication.</li>
                <li>A lack of access to all of your health records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;</li>

                <li>Security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal health information.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>By accepting these Terms of Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree with the following: You understand that you may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telemedicine in your care, but that no results can be assured or guaranteed.</p>

            <p>You understand that the laws that protect the privacy and security of health information apply to telemedicine, and have received ConnectHealth’s Privacy Policy, which describes these protections in more detail. Electronic communications are directed to your Provider(s) and their supervisees through an SSL secured communication channel.</p>
            <p>
                Your Provider may determine that the Services are not appropriate for some or all of your treatment needs, and accordingly may elect not to provide telemedicine services to you through the Site. You may seek a second opinion from another Provider or terminate a User-Provider at any time.</p>

            <p>You can send messages to your Provider by contacting ConnectHealth Customer Support through support at connecthealth dot com or through its chat helpline on the Site homepage. Emails or electronic messages to Customer Support or your Provider may not be returned immediately.</p>
            <p>If you are experiencing a medical emergency, you should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency facility.</p>

            <h4>Privacy</h4>

            <p>Information regarding our use of health and other personal information is provided in our Privacy Policy.
